		<h1>The Eagle</h1>
		<h3>Alfred Lord Tennyson</h3>
		<pre id="poem"><!--better version of <p> for peom maybe(?)-->
			He clasps the crag with crooked hands;
			Close to the sun in lonely lands,
			Ring'd with the azure world, he stands. 

			The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;
			He watches from his mountain walls,
			And like a thunderbolt he falls.
